Peer Review: Site looks good and functions as should. Good job on the local storage. It would have been nice if there was an on click funciton to load the data back onto the main page

critiques: - could add a click even on other favorites to reroute them to the main page
	- you could do this by passing a prop from the favorites page over to the main page
- responsiveness for some screen sizes cut some content off
- The main page.tsx has alot styling and components that could be sectioned off into differnt components to clean up the code
